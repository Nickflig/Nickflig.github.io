Web Design Proposal for COMP208 Assessment 1

The bottom of main.css contains my own custom code, but code was modified throughout all of main.css (and of course the html pages).

All buttons functional.
This web page shows off my ability to not only link to a new page, but also my ability to make buttons and links which navigate to difference sections of the same or fifferent pages.
Portfolio is on a separate page in order to:
	1. Show my ability to have these functions across separate pages
	2. In proper practice, my portfolio of past work should become a long page in future
