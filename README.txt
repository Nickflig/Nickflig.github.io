Web Design Proposal for Professor Herb Marsh

Much of the css file  regarding page spacing was borrowed from a Miniport template as I'm not very talented with coding.
However, the graphical design is of my own doing. I chose green as the main colour to symbolise growth yet professionality. I am not a graphic designer.
I also feel light blue would suit very well, or we can go with purple for ACU colour representation.

All buttons functional. Try them out, anything I couldn't work I just removed since I'm sure I'll redo and redesign swathes of this based on feedback.
Just keep in mind:
	1. The website would only be one page as I suspect it would allow for a lighter server load and I feel gives the site a more modern feel
	2. This is only a first prototype designed to help you get a better feel of what you want from this project - thus serving as means to obtain specific feedback on how this should look.
